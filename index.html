			<h2>gun show loophole restricted in several states</h2>
			<p>According to smartgunlaws.org, there are 9 states that require a background check at the point of transfer, two that require a background check before the sale or transfer of a firearm at a gun show, and, to quote, "eight states regulate private sales primarily by prohibiting private sellers from transferring certain firearms to purchasers who do not have the requisite state license or permit, and requiring a background check before issuing the license or permit." That's nineteen states. So though the gun show loophole is legal federally, there are plenty of laws essentially prohibiting it in many states.</p>

			<h2>affirmative plan very expensive (ar15 rifle)</h2>
			<p>According to Slate's Justin Peters, there are roughly 3,750,000 AR-15 rifles, which the shooter in the Sandy Hook Shooting used, in the U.S. Multiply that by the average cost of an AR-15 (thetruthaboutguns.org), and it would cost roughly

					<li>1,733,550,000 if the U.S. purchased every AR-15 for 100% of its retail value.</li>
					<li>1,300,162,500 if the U.S. purchased every AR-15 for 75% of its retail value.</li>
					<li>866,775,000 if the U.S. purchased every AR-15 for 50% of its retail value.</li>
					<li>433,387,500 if the U.S. purchased every AR-15 for 25% of its retail value.</li>
